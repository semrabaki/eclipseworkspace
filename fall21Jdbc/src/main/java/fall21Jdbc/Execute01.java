		  execute() method can be used in DDL(Table creation, drop table, alter table) and DQL(SELECT)
		  1) If you use execute() method in DDL you will get false everytime
		  2)If you use execute() method in DQL you will get true or false
		     When you use execute() method in DQL, if you get ResultSet Object as return, you will get true 
		     otherwise you will get false

		//1.Example: Create a workers table with the columns worker_id, worker_name, worker_salary
		
		String sql1="CREATE TABLE workers (worker_id CHAR(3), worker_name VARCHAR2(50), worker_salary NUMBER (7,2))";
		boolean result= st. execute(sql1);
	    System.out.println("execute() method returned : " + result+ " for table creation");//I got false from here, it means no record returned
		
	    //2.Example: Alter table by adding worker_address column into the workers table
	    String sql2="ALTER TABLE workers ADD worker_address VARCHAR2(50)";
	    boolean result2=st.execute(sql2);
	    System.out.println("execute() method returned : " + result2+ " for table altering");

//	    String sql3= "DROP TABLE workers";
//	    boolean result3=st.execute(sql3);
//	    System.out.println("execute() method returned: "+ result3+" for table dropping");
		//7.Step:Close the con, and st
